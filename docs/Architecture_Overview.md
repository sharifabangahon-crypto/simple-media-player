Architecture Overview

This media player showcases a modular, pattern-driven design built for flexibility and easy extension. It integrates several structural patterns working together:

1.	Adapter: MediaSource implementations (LocalFileSource, HlsStreamSource, RemoteApiSource) adapt various input types to a unified Stream interface.
2. Bridge: RenderImpl classes (SoftwareRenderImpl, HardwareRenderImpl) decouple high-level player logic from low-level rendering mechanisms.
3. Decorator: PlayerDecorator subclasses (SubtitlePlugin, EqualizerPlugin, WatermarkPlugin) dynamically add extra features to a MediaPlayer instance at runtime.
4. Proxy: CachingProxy acts as an intermediary for MediaSource objects, improving performance by caching accessed streams.
5. Composite: Playlist implements Media, allowing both single media items and collections of items to be handled uniformly.

Overall, the design promotes scalability and maintainability by allowing new renderers, sources, or player extensions to be added with minimal code changes.
